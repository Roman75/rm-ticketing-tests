"# rm-ticketing-admin" 

basic implementation was done at https://github.com/Roman75/ticketing

here we begin to split each part into separate project to run each in separate docker container (microservice concept will be implemented) 

for dev start dev.sh

on deploy to dockerhub we now use a basic nginx setup in Dockerfile

```bash
simple explenation will follow
```
